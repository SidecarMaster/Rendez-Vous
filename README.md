# Shanghai-10-Must-Sees

## How To Use the Application
  This is an application to show the 10 must-see attractions in Shanghai.
  1. In the desktop mode, a panel on the left side of the website shows the 10 must-see attractions in Shanghai. In the phone mode, you may click the burger-menu at the upper-right corner, and the panel will display.
  2. In the panel, there is an input box and a list of 10 attractions under it. In the input box, when you type in the name of an attraction, the list below it updates instantly, only displaying attractions that include the characters you type in. And the markers in the map will also update accordingly.
  3. When you click on an item in the list in the panel, or directly on a marker in the map, the map will set the marker as the center of the map, and zoom to the area of the marker. The marker will start bouncing. Also an Info Window will pop up, displaying a panorama street view and the name of the attraction, as well as wikipedia links related to the attraction. When you close the Info Window, the marker will stop bouncing, and the map will zoom out to fit all markers inside the map.
